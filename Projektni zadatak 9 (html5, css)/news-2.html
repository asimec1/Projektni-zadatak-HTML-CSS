			<h2>Wall Street: Tech firm surge pushes US markets higher</h2>
			<p class="description">Investors piled into technology giants such as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft on Friday, driving the tech-heavy Nasdaq to one of its biggest one-day jumps this year.</p>
			<p>The gains came after the firms' quarterly results blew past forecasts.
			<p>The Nasdaq surged 2.2%, adding 144.49 points to close at 6,701.26.</p>
			<p>The S&P rose 20.67 points, or 0.8%, to 2,581, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.3 points, or 0.14%, to 23,434.19.</p>
			<p>US markets have rallied this year, driven in part by a rise in major tech stocks.</p>
			<p>That had slowed in recent weeks, but accelerated after the earnings reports on Thursday.</p>
			<p>On Friday, the Commerce Department reported stronger-than-expected 3% growth in the third quarter, adding to market optimism.</p>
			<p>Shares in Amazon jumped by than 13%, after it said third quarter sales increased 34% to $43.7bn.</p>
			<p>Alphabet shares jumped more than 4% after the firm said third quarter revenue climbed 24% to $27.8 billion.</p>
			<p>Apple was also higher after it said sales of its newest phone were strong. This followed recent reports that sales had been sluggish.</p>
			<p>The gains masked stumbles for some companies - even in the tech sector.</p>
			<p>Expedia, for example, plunged by nearly 16% after disappointing investors by saying growth would not be as strong as expected.</p>
			<p>Expedia is also among the hotel booking sites that will be probed by the UK's competition watchdog.</p>
